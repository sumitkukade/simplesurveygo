REST is highly scalable and maintainable to make an web app,
for me rest is a thinking that will teach us to write easy to understand and maintanable REST servicies,
it makes APIs easy to use and understand

unlike regular services it is very helpfull to scale an app and easy to understand..
regular services are not scalable.
